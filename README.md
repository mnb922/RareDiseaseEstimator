# RareDiseaseEstimator
Estimate the incidence of a rare disease
Extremely rare diseases are increasingly recognized due to wide-spread, inexpensive genomic sequencing. Estimating the incidence 
of rare disease is challenging because the individual contributory alleles are, themselves, extremely rare. We propose a new method 
to determine the incidence of rare, severe, recessive disease that uses known allele frequencies, and estimates the combined allele 
frequency of observed alleles, and estimates the number of causative alleles that are thus far unobserved in a disease cohort. 
Experiments on simulated and real data show that this approach is a feasible method to estimate the incidence of rare disease in 
European populations.
